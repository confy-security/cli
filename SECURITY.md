# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security is very important to Confy CLI. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly to us immediately.

### ⚠️ Important

**DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities. Public disclosure can put the entire community at risk. Instead, please follow the responsible disclosure process outlined below.

## How to Report a Security Vulnerability

### Step 1: Send a Report

Send an email to: **[confy@henriquesebastiao.com](mailto:confy@henriquesebastiao.com)**

Include the following information in your report:

```txt
Subject: [SECURITY] Vulnerability Report - Confy CLI

1. Type of vulnerability (e.g., credential exposure, authentication bypass, network interception)
2. Description of the vulnerability
3. Location in the code (file path, function name, line numbers if possible)
4. Steps to reproduce the issue
5. Proof of concept or sample code (if applicable)
6. Expected vs. actual behavior
7. Potential impact and severity
8. Your contact information (optional, but recommended)
```

### Step 2: What to Include

To help us understand and address the vulnerability faster, please provide:

- **Detailed description:** What is the vulnerability and how does it manifest?
- **Affected versions:** Which versions of Confy CLI are affected?
- **Reproduction steps:** Provide clear, step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- **Code sample:** Include sample code or configuration that demonstrates the vulnerability
- **Impact assessment:** Explain what an attacker could do with this vulnerability
- **Suggested fix:** If you have an idea for a patch, please share it
- **Your research:** Include any relevant research or references

### Step 3: Response Timeline

- **24 hours:** We acknowledge receipt of your report
- **72 hours:** We provide an initial assessment and may request clarification
- **7 days:** We confirm the vulnerability status
- **14 days:** We provide an estimated patch timeline
- **Ongoing:** Regular updates on progress

## What Happens After You Report

### Investigation Process

1. **Acknowledgment** - We confirm receipt of your report within 24 hours
2. **Analysis** - Our security team analyzes the vulnerability
3. **Verification** - We verify the vulnerability in our codebase
4. **Development** - We develop and test a fix
5. **Release** - We release a patched version
6. **Disclosure** - We publicly disclose the vulnerability and credit you (if desired)

### Communication

- We will keep you informed throughout the process
- We will discuss the vulnerability details only with those who need to know
- We will not disclose your identity without permission
- We will ask for your consent before crediting you publicly

## Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline

### Embargo Period

After we acknowledge a vulnerability report, we enforce an embargo period:

- **Critical vulnerabilities:** 30 days maximum before public disclosure
- **High severity vulnerabilities:** 45 days maximum before public disclosure
- **Medium severity vulnerabilities:** 60 days maximum before public disclosure
- **Low severity vulnerabilities:** 90 days maximum before public disclosure

During this period, we request that you do not publicly disclose the vulnerability.

### Public Disclosure

After the embargo period or when a patch is released (whichever comes first), we will:

1. Release a security patch
2. Publish a security advisory
3. Credit the reporter (with permission)
4. Provide mitigation guidance for users who cannot update immediately

## Known Security Considerations

### WebSocket Communication

Confy CLI uses WebSocket connections for peer-to-peer messaging. Users should be aware:

- ✔️ **We use the cryptography library** - Actively maintained and regularly audited
- ✔️ **We implement best practices** - RSA-OAEP and AES-256-CFB encryption
- ⚠️ **Server certificates are your responsibility** - Use SSL/TLS for WebSocket connections
- ⚠️ **Key management is critical** - Securely handle RSA private keys

### Credential Handling

The CLI handles sensitive cryptographic material:

- Never log cryptographic keys or private data
- Always use secure key storage mechanisms
- Rotate keys regularly
- Use environment variables for configuration (not hardcoded values)

### Network Security

When using Confy CLI:

- Always connect to trusted servers
- Use HTTPS/WSS for all connections (never unencrypted WS)
- Verify server SSL certificates
- Be cautious of man-in-the-middle attacks

### Dependency Security

We actively monitor our dependencies for security vulnerabilities:

- **Dependabot** - Automated dependency monitoring (daily checks)
- **Manual audits** - Regular security reviews
- **Rapid patching** - Quick updates when vulnerabilities are discovered

## Security Best Practices for Users

### When Using Confy CLI

1. **Keep software updated** - Run the latest version of Confy CLI
2. **Update dependencies** - Keep Python and all packages up to date
3. **Use strong identifiers** - Choose unique, non-guessable user IDs
4. **Secure storage** - Store private keys in secure locations
5. **Network security** - Always use encrypted connections (WSS, not WS)
6. **Verify peers** - Confirm you're communicating with the right person
7. **Monitor activity** - Watch for suspicious connection attempts
8. **Use backups** - Maintain encrypted backups of important keys

### Key Management

```bash
# ✅ Good: Use environment variables for sensitive data
export CONFY_USER_ID="your-secure-id"
confy start $CONFY_USER_ID recipient-id

# ❌ Bad: Don't hardcode sensitive information
confy start hardcoded-user-id recipient-id  # DON'T DO THIS!
```

### Server Configuration

```bash
# ✅ Good: Use secure WSS connections
confy start user-id recipient-id
# Then enter: wss://secure-server.com

# ❌ Bad: Use unencrypted connections
# NEVER use: ws://insecure-server.com
```

## Security Features

### What Confy CLI Provides

- **End-to-end encryption** - Messages encrypted with AES-256
- **Digital signatures** - RSA-based message authentication
- **Key exchange** - Secure RSA key exchange (4096-bit keys)
- **Session isolation** - Separate keys for each conversation
- **Input validation** - Validation of all received messages
- **Error handling** - Secure error messages without leaking information

### What Confy CLI Does NOT Provide

- ❌ **Perfect forward secrecy** - Keys are not rotated per message
- ❌ **Offline message queuing** - Messages are lost if recipient is offline
- ❌ **Message timestamps** - No cryptographic timestamps
- ❌ **Deniability** - Messages can be attributed to the sender
